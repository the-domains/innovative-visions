I am a freelance makeup artist and licensed esthetician based out of Denver, CO. As a licensed Esthetician each makeup application will be customized to your individual skin care needs to create a flawless look. I only use the highest quality cosmetics and latex free products. From natural bridal makeup to edgy Avant Garde, I take pride and passion in creating the perfect look for each unique face. I am experienced in (but not limited to): bridal, print, fashion, fantasy and runway.
